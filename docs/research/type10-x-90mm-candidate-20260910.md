# Type 10 X: fitted 90 mm running gear — owner-approved checkpoint

Base: published `8f879124415f2734e8020de07b69a03afac4d96c`.
This follows the earlier skirt/support checkpoint. Publication uses the two
explicit owner decisions below; it is not an all-gates-qualified release.
Do not replace its failed source row or claim a complete npm lifecycle PASS.

## Persistent checkout recovery

On 2026-09-10, the temporary checkout
`/private/tmp/cot-japan-running-gear.PUiEBf` and its running test handle were
no longer present. Git still contained all nine unpublished commits through
`fe571abbe226738a06a6acfaa1033c9e9d603a2a`. They were restored unchanged to
`/Users/kevinliu/.codex/worktrees/cot-type10-durable-release-20260910` on
`codex/type10-durable-release-20260910`; the shared dirty checkout was not
modified. A fresh fetch confirmed base `f32fbd387` was still `origin/main`.

The temporary `.qa-dev/` paths cited below are historical evidence locations,
not currently available artifacts. In particular the final outcome of
`type10-integrated-tail-OCe2Vs` cannot be recovered from that checkout and
must not be described as passing. Committed source receipts remain available.
A fresh complete npm lifecycle, typecheck and private/public builds are now
recorded in this persistent checkout's `.qa-dev/durable-release-20260910/`.
These are verification outputs, excluded from source control.

The recovered runtime passes typecheck/core-unused and both private/public
builds. The fresh complete anatomy check also passes: 181 receipts across
57 groups, all 181 marking-seat receipts, 1,552 authored modules and 362
track sides with no failed/outside-envelope hits, and 543 current technical
diagram files. Its 83 pre-existing dimension warnings remain visible.
These passes did not establish a complete npm lifecycle result.

That lifecycle subsequently **failed** in the core phase at
`src/world/terrainStreaming.selftest.mjs`: the Frontier authored-geometry
digest was `3410c303…`, while its historical snapshot expected `7923000c…`.
All 306 pre-tests passed; the core runner completed 224 checks, including
that failure, before draining. Post-tests were not run. The full npm
lifecycle therefore did not pass. This run's runtime was frozen at
`fe571abbe`; the later local recovery commit changed documentation only.

A fresh fetch found the historical/current terrain distinction already fixed
upstream in `3dc009b93`, alongside the Redrock release and battle ERA-audit
optimization, then the Redrock material refinement. The actual recovered
candidate ancestry is based on `503d8e957` (which includes `26d556281`). No terrain
golden was changed locally. Before another full qualification, a diagnostic
runs all previously unpassed or newly registered checks, retaining each
actual child result and continuing after failures to expose them together.
It is not a full npm release certificate and cannot turn the failed prefix
into one. Outputs are in `.qa-dev/durable-post-rebase-20260910/`.

That diagnostic completed all 441 remaining/new checks: 436 passed and five
failed in the sourced-image plan harness, road-lookup historical source hash,
winter-shoreline historical input and loading-order harness. All five now pass
after bounded test/tool-only repairs; seven focused checks also retain the
independent current-relief/canyon proofs. No tank or terrain runtime changed.
The fixes were separately pushed as `88e48ff85` to `origin/main`, excluding
this unreleased candidate. See `selftest-release-throughput-20260910.md`.

The fresh official npm lifecycle on frozen runtime/test commit `996df6b06`
**failed**: all 307 pre-tests passed (22m02.791s), then 92 of 93 completed
core checks passed (4m35.088s). The one failure was generated garage terrain
freshness after the upstream Redrock refinement. Post-tests did not run.
All active full-fleet workers drained successfully; this remains a failed
lifecycle, not a composed PASS. Typecheck/core-unused and both private/public
builds completed successfully. Logs are in `.qa-dev/durable-final-20260910/`.

The owning garage generator refreshed its stale excerpt and its freshness
check passed. The first affected-consumer attempt then missed the unchanged
100 ms headless build budget at 100.9 ms; the other consumer did not run.
Retain that failed attempt in `garage-refresh.log` and retry the affected
checks after integration, without widening the timing limit.

The owner separately approved on 2026-09-10: **"Push after affected checks;
finish full suite separately"**, in direct response to the stale garage
failure and the proposed targeted release. This permits publishing this
checkpoint after refreshed data and affected checks pass, while the full
suite runs separately. It does not turn the failed lifecycle into a PASS,
waive physical fit checks, or apply automatically to other candidates.

After integrating `991940cd6`, all 12 affected checks pass in
`affected-checks.log`: the actual deployment-order oracle and runtime,
generated garage freshness and both garage consumers, closed paired stock,
finite loaded-track contact, tapered carriers, native Type 10 HIGH/LOW moving
running gear, skirt/support attachments, fleet progress watchdog and CPU
scheduler. The garage timing retry retains the original 100 ms limit.
The loading oracle follows the upstream helper refactor and adds deferred
scene-health/reveal checks plus negative controls; no deployment runtime
was changed. Fresh typecheck/core-unused and private/public builds also pass
after integration (`integrated-builds.log`, terminal exit 0). A fresh complete
lifecycle remains separately outstanding.

Publication is limited to Kevin's explicit Type 10 fitting decision quoted
below, together with his standing instruction to push completed checkpoints
to `origin/main`. The question named the frozen source-shape failure and the
roughly 9 cm ground-envelope change; the answer selected the fitted running
gear. Retain the raw geometric and silhouette failures caused by that chosen
target. This exception does not extend to other tanks, physical intersections,
missing physical coverage or failing affected checks. The separate targeted
publication approval above governs the pending full-suite result only.

## Implemented

- A reusable closed paired-wheel primitive, metal dishes/hub/fasteners and
  distinct rubber rims; a real 100 mm central guide channel.
- The actual Japanese staggered-rib recipe through the quality-aware fleet
  shoe builder; no source buffers and no counterfeit NATO pattern identity.
- A 90 mm carrier, original road/end axle centres and wheel radii, 4 mm end
  contact allowance, 16-step wrap arcs without duplicate course cells.
- Six fitted composite return rotors, canonical hull-connected spindles and
  2.5 mm upper-course allowance. Actual spin radii are not altered to move stock.

## Measured, not a release certificate

`pairedRunningGearStock.selftest.mjs`: eight HIGH/LOW, steel/rubber fixtures;
closed outward stock, finite attributes/UVs, real guide air and 13 negative
controls pass. Typecheck/core-unused and Type 10's independent source feature,
stock/air/weapon/ownership witnesses pass. That test now checks ground contact
with native `seatOnFloor`, separately from the unchanged raw source frame.

`.qa-dev/type10-production-contact.mjs` ran each detail level on actual native
battle geometry: 64 moving poses at the real +0.30/−0.22 m suspension clamps
and a nonflat wave. Minimum track/roller separation is 0.485 mm; conservative
road-stock/roller separation 10.950 mm. Continuous near/far shoe bounds pass.
At 15/75/200 m and 27 phases, maximum visible roller/support gaps are
2.957 mm HIGH and 5.026 mm LOW, below the unchanged 6 mm limit.

The preceding 3 mm-crown prototype measured 63,166 HIGH / 39,238 LOW
LOD-selected, instance-expanded triangles. Counts must be recaptured at the
final candidate; these are not GPU submissions or a frozen class-budget pass.
Native HIGH angle/front/side/top frames were captured and inspected in
`.qa-dev/type10-90mm-native`, alongside original Type 10 controls. They are
diagnostic views, not an official full-view independent visual certification.

## Explicit owner target decision

The frozen source is unchanged (SHA-256
`fb6c2aa30119ac45b49fdfb7393a13760109ce4c9cc3f6244e579eb4944879fe`).
The early 3 mm-crown source check fails **79.4/92**, with whole shape **89.5**.
Actual physical height is 4.209195 m versus source 4.121557 m: retaining axle
positions while fitting the thicker course extends the ground envelope by
87.638 mm. The narrower ground-space source cannot simultaneously remain exact.
The final 2.5 mm-clearance candidate was source-regated after rebasing onto
`9919b26b9`: the raw result remains **79.4/92**, whole shape **89.5**,
floaters **100**, registration **PASS**. The source oracle is unchanged.

On 2026-09-10 the owner explicitly selected **"Prioritize fitted thicker running
gear"** after being told that retaining the axle centres extends the ground
envelope by roughly 9 cm and fails the frozen source-shape check. The intended
design is now the fitted 90 mm course, not preservation of the source's thin
ground envelope. This is an accepted design deviation, not a claim that the
unchanged source score passes, and not a waiver of contact or release checks.

No source transform, threshold or reference was changed. Initial fitting
iterations stopped before anatomy/assets/full release. After the owner chose
the thicker target and native contact tests passed, release evidence collection
started on `a82edb9f6`. It retains any raw source-stage failures and collects
the remaining official stages; it does not label a failed composed gate PASS.

The bounded gear-call inverse is now implemented in the historical test
helpers. Both old whole-source hashes and both old native whole-model hashes
pass unchanged. An undeclared source edit is still rejected. The actual
candidate also passes `sourceXOtherAuxArmor.selftest.mjs --ids=type10_x` at
HIGH/LOW: 1,744 auxiliary faces, 2,320 independent held-out rays per detail,
2,405 seams / 196 owned edges, with maximum held-out surface error 2.303 mm.
The paired-stock primitive test is registered in the full npm lifecycle;
the registry at that initial checkpoint accounted for 958 checks, before the
additional finite-contact, tapered-carrier and native Type 10 regressions.

## Fitted contact follow-up

The broader native road-stock sweep found a real missing constraint: the
original lower course cut into an end road wheel by 28.916 mm at full droop.
Holding its end influence alone reduced that failure but still left a
10.673 mm wave-pose intersection. The new opt-in `fitLoadedRun` solves the
finite lower spans against the live wheel-rim envelopes. It keeps duplicated
cross-sections welded, preserves band thickness, reuses constructor-owned
scratch, and feeds the existing near/far moving shoes from the same course.
The existing endpoint-ownership table was correct and is not changed.

A full-width carrier also intersected the canonical sprocket teeth. Narrowing
the entire carrier fixed the tooth intersection but failed actual visible
roller support (48.621 mm gap). The final closed carrier is recessed only in
the sprocket's lateral engagement lanes: 420 mm through z = −2.40 m, tapering
back to the original 486.738 mm at z = −2.30 m. Collinear transition sections
retain one connected course; all return-roller crowns retain full-width stock.

Final native HIGH/LOW observations on this candidate:

- `type10XRunningGear.selftest.mjs`: all ten road wheels, actual +0.30/−0.22 m
  axle travel and wave terrain, 16 link phases per pose; **128 poses pass**,
  minimum finite stock clearance **1.2585 mm**. Moving a real carrier upward
  is rejected as a negative control. Six return rotors must actually exist.
- The repeated roller-motion test still gives minimum **0.4852 mm** clearance;
  visible support is **2.957 mm HIGH / 5.026 mm LOW** at 15/75/200 m, below
  the unchanged 6 mm limit. The committed regression includes this support
  check, not only a component-count assertion.
- Native batched end-body/hardware edge-crossing diagnostic: zero carrier
  crossings for all four end wheels, four spin phases and both details.
  This is a finite crossing diagnostic, not a complete containment proof.
- The final LOD-selected, instance-expanded census is **63,230 HIGH / 39,302
  LOW** triangles. Published skirt/support checkpoint `8f8791244` was
  **70,542 / 65,886**: an additional **10.37% / 40.35%** reduction. This is
  not a GPU timing or switch-latency claim.
- The shared-default preservation test still matches its immutable published
  fingerprint in all twelve assemblies and 96 motion snapshots. Other
  vehicles do not opt into the new lower-span fitting or lateral taper.
- Primitive disposal is now observed independently: all indexed inputs,
  flattened copies and HIGH fasteners release exactly once. Returned stock
  retains native ownership. No geometry vertices change in this disposal fix.
- Fresh typecheck/core-unused and source panel/ballistics/history tests pass;
  the old source and native hashes are unchanged, with the new opt-in fields
  explicitly removed only inside the historical reconstruction helper.

The final strict native track-clip sweep passes front/rear carrier, shoe and
wrap checks with zero reported intersections. HIGH/LOW wheel-quality checks
also pass. The in-app native close review covered full-vehicle front, side and
rear quarters, plus isolated running gear in LOW droop/wave and HIGH
compression. Camouflaged fixed skirts, painted stock, separate neutral
stowage, six rollers and articulated carrier are present. Diagnostic floor
height does not follow the artificial suspension fixtures; its clipping is
not a terrain-contact observation. An initial preview mistakenly requested
geometry-only receipt materials; that preview was corrected and reloaded
before material review. These are close diagnostic views, not a substitute
for the registered source board or an independent 14-view score.

Required anatomy regeneration passes, including the full-fleet technical
diagram refresh; only Type 10 assets/receipts differ. The first anatomy-check
attempt stopped at a real stale presentation receipt: native/saved diagrams
measure `centerYM: 2.017`, but the old runtime projection still says `2.0608`.
Its preceding anatomy/marking freshness and combat/module-hit checks pass
(181 tanks, 1,552 authored modules, 362 track sides; zero failures and 83
pre-existing dimension warnings). That composed attempt is **FAIL**, not a
release certificate. The selected centering generator and all ten Type 10
assets have now been refreshed before a new complete check/release attempt.
The generated horizontal centre also changes by 0.1 mm; no other vehicle's
anchor or projection changes. No manual projection or generated evidence edit
is used.

The retry on `a7055a197` (rebased onto `dab4f986e`) passes the selected
ten-view asset preflight and the complete `npm run tank:anatomy:check`:
181 anatomy/marking receipts, combat-anatomy tests, module hits and all
543 technical-diagram assets are current. Evidence is retained in
`.qa-dev/type10-target-release-pztQzY/`. Later release stages remain pending.

Fresh strict source stages retain both failures: geometric minimum
**79.3678/92** and visual aggregate **92.4624**, with front-left **90.5540**,
left **89.5187**, right **89.7313**, front-right **91.1222** and tracks
**90.9967** below the per-view/component floor of 92. Registration passes;
no reference is unavailable. The new neutral source/native comparison and
articulation/turntable board was inspected. The intended thicker running-gear
silhouette is visibly different; aggregate 92.5 is not a fidelity PASS.

Because the forced source stage exits before its remaining physical checks,
an additional ordinary `tank-standard-check.mjs --ids=type10_x` collected
those unchanged checks against the fresh failed source packet: carrier/wrap
and animated sweeps **0/0+0/0**, enclosed-hole census **0**, and **mg1**.
Its overall status remains **FAIL solely on the source minimum**, not PASS.
Targeted centering, module visual alignment, module hits, current selected
assets, duplicate-track and muzzle-bore stages also pass in the release retry.

Final scoped Doctor scanned 17 files: **84/100, one warning** for chained
map/filter/sort calls in `splitCarrierSections`. This is constructor-only
course splitting over Type 10's two width stations, not the allocation-free
per-frame fit. No measured material cost or correctness failure was found;
the warning is retained, not suppressed, and is not a clean-scan claim.

The retry subsequently failed its integrated `npm test` pre-phase at the
historical all-seven auxiliary-armor snapshot. Independently loading the
`9919b26b9` Type 10 calibration through the same spec initialization proved
that exactly 16 scalar leaves differ: the two track module bounds and their
derived ellipsoid centres/radii. No other armor leaf differs. The historical
comparison now reverses only those declared values on a clone, asserts the
current values before reversal, and retains the original seven-ID golden.
A changed-track negative control rejects undeclared coordinates, and the
live candidate is asserted unmodified. The actual current-candidate trace
checks remain unchanged: **15,975 full-result controls pass**, with 2,084
conservative bounds and seven exact fallbacks. The failed composed run is
retained; a fresh integrated test/build tail is still required.

That fresh tail on `06446f5f3` stopped before the corrected armor comparison:
`fleetLazy.selftest.mjs` hit its unchanged 240-second child watchdog while
competing with other full-fleet CPU checks. No loading assertion failed.
The failed attempt is retained at `.qa-dev/type10-integrated-tail-Jd7aQu/`;
after observing the timeout, the owning runner was terminated to stop its
remaining children and release the queue. This is an interrupted failed
attempt, not a successful fleet sweep or a complete npm lifecycle.

The scheduler now runs that one timeout-sensitive CPU file exclusively under
the runner-owned lease. It drains earlier CPU work, keeps the lease while the
file runs, and yields the normal FIFO after a long exclusive file. Later CPU
checks retain eight-worker concurrency. The fleet test's source, coverage,
assertions and 240-second watchdog are unchanged. Scheduler controls cover
both success and failure at two, four and eight workers. A new real complete
run is required before any integrated-release claim.

The next run (`919b68ba2`, `.qa-dev/type10-integrated-tail-ENeI1V/`)
passed the unchanged loading sweep in **175.345 s** (207 demand-owned
profiles, 171 visible native builds). Full-fleet wheel quality, ERA
registration and machine-gun attachment also passed. It then stopped on two
test-structure assumptions: the guard-paint comparator assumed a scalar
material, and the earlier skirt-support test requested the old separate
`gearReturnRollerDiscs` mesh. The new closed roller has a rubber/paint material
array and is named `gearReturnRollerRotors`. The comparator now compares
every material slot and geometry group; it does not skip these meshes.

The support test now targets the actual six rotors. Its former |x|=.95 hub
ray began inside the new hub (inner cap |x|=.94414), so the outward-facing
cap was backface-culled. Starting at |x|=.90 outside the closed hub restores
the same physical receiver test. The hull-lap range and exact 3 mm hub
engagement assertions are unchanged and pass at HIGH/LOW and all three
tested hull yaws. No production geometry changed in either test correction.

The full 27-file Type 10-related preflight then passed, including native
running gear, original Type 10 controls, materials, source/historical
preservation, roof/gun fixtures, wrecks, balance and ordering. Its logs are
retained at `.qa-dev/type10-related-preflight-mO9vAw/`.

The following complete attempt on `dafbba644` passed all **306 pre-tests**
and reached 207 core tests, stopping on the obsolete world-loading
source-order assertion already corrected upstream in `f6622924a`. It is
retained as FAIL at `.qa-dev/type10-integrated-tail-lGzyku/`. After rebase,
that world test passes. The next attempt on `c4662ac83` nevertheless hit the
fleet-loading aggregate 240-second watchdog again, even with exclusive CPU
scheduling (`.qa-dev/type10-integrated-tail-NiJTz9/`). Neither attempt is a
complete lifecycle PASS.

The functional loading sweep now reports completed vehicle IDs through IPC.
Its watchdog changes explicitly from a **240-second aggregate wall limit**
to a **240-second no-progress limit**. Only the next ID in the declared,
unique fleet sequence resets the deadline; arbitrary logs, duplicate or
out-of-order IDs cannot. A zero exit without every ID is rejected. A stalled
child receives SIGTERM then SIGKILL after five seconds if needed, and the
parent retains its queue lease until the owned child closes. Total duration
and longest progress interval are always reported; exceeding 240 seconds
in total remains a **SLOW diagnostic**, not a performance PASS. Coverage and
all tank assertions remain intact. This is a functional-test flakiness fix,
not evidence that tank switching is fast. Deterministic stalled/malformed/
incomplete/signal/spawn/exit controls and actual IPC/exit controls pass.
