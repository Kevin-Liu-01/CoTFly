# T-14 X fitted-roller recovery — 2026-09-10

## Frozen release qualification

The complete release passed at `f33618e066d63236d658c735751ccccec7ba4b44`
on base `77639501dbb87399e3796f76b50edcf81c0c471e`. The local commits
`0a7543223`, `57bb259a1` and `f33618e06` contain the recovered fitting,
bounded test-order change and selected generated assets. Final-main integration
is recorded separately below; this is not permission to replay
the older mixed K2/T-14 branch wholesale.

The fitting is recovered from `154ddf0cd` / `1b17c1eef` / `e81a12f16`, with a
fresh measured-clamp regression. K2 X remains outside this checkpoint: its
90.8137 source score still fails the unchanged 92-point floor.

## Physical and visual scope

- Four inferred stations per side, eight closed two-material rollers and eight
  finite painted hull spindles. The shared efficient primitive costs 160 HIGH /
  80 LOW triangles per complete assembly, or 1,280 / 640 for the eight assemblies.
- All original hull/turret/fitting emissions, road/end-wheel axes and the loaded
  lower course are preserved. The supported upper course restores Y 1.085 m.
- Nine native builds, 128 measured poses and three failing negative controls.
  Every road axle reaches the actual +0.30 / −0.22 m clamps. Conservative
  finite-road clearance is at least 22.7499 mm; continuous shoe clearance is
  at least 63 mm. Band-contact roundoff stays within the 2 µm tolerance.
- At 15 / 75 / 200 m and 27 phases, worst visible-support gaps are 0.770 mm
  HIGH and 3.067 mm LOW. The legacy LOW control still fails at 6.851 mm.
  Independent track-side spin, battle ownership and exactly-once disposal pass.
- Neutral and colored native turntable/source boards were inspected, including
  articulation strips. The hull recesses and turret negative space remain.
  Concealed rollers are counted/contact-tested in geometry, not guessed from
  an occluded screenshot. The four-per-side layout remains an inferred fit.

This is not completion of country-matched track thickness or the full 59-vehicle
style/performance contract. It does not modify K2 or the original playable T-14.

## Gates and retained evidence

Local receipts are retained under `.qa-dev/` and are not public source assets:

- `t14-recovery-preflight-NhQ9Ku/receipt.json`: eight focused tests, strict code
  metrics, source/geometry checks, types and scoped Doctor passed.
- `t14-recovery-assets-EMCF9S/receipt.json`: remains **FAIL**. Complete anatomy
  generation and selected images passed, but the old projection center failed
  the subsequent full anatomy check. This failure was not relabeled or spliced.
- `t14-presentation-sync-E3ZJnm/`: the maintained `--sync-assets --ids=t14_x`
  path verified saved hashes against fresh rendering, then corrected only the
  selected projection center Y from 1.8864 to 1.8885 m. Anchors, half-extents and
  every unselected record stayed unchanged. Centering/assets/order controls pass.
- `t14-recovery-release-5gBMkZ/receipt.json`: a fresh **complete** anatomy check,
  all twelve release stages, types, scoped Doctor and public build passed.
  The one uninterrupted npm lifecycle passed **947 files: 301 pre, 608 core,
  38 post**. Private build also passed. Doctor has zero errors and one low-risk
  test-only repeated-property-access warning, not a production-loop finding.

Strict raw geometry minimum is **94.86282807496896 / 92**; native source fidelity
is **97.0** rounded. Track/sweep intersections and continuity holes are zero.
Centering residual is 0.00 px, exported top residual 0.03 px. The selected module
probe has zero failures and outside-envelope hits; muzzle/circularity checks pass.
The full fleet module probe has zero failures and 83 retained dimension warnings.

Private comparison oracle SHA-256:
`48745114206a2123e687f75477526caac0ad3896bd677639f44995d44b97e769`.
It is a converted local oracle, distinct from the raw owner-file SHA in the
[source record](../references/tanks/t14_x.md). Neither file enters the game or commit.

## Test throughput

The unchanged four-worker policy now groups eleven long whole-fleet tests at
the start of their existing phases. Exact membership, phase ownership, remaining
order, fresh-process execution and browser barriers are retained. The full run
took 1,424.710 s (23m44.710s), including 232.649 s measured runner FIFO wait;
summed overlapping child time was 3,525.876 s. These are measured totals, not
a matched speedup percentage. No test, assertion or gate was removed.

## Final-main integration

The checkpoint was rebased onto published renderer/production evidence
`5bfcc3b502d78e4adce65b16ad669dcb46c200cd`. Rebasing produces `a681223d4`
(fitting), `5683152fa` (scheduling), `8d442e7b1` (assets) and `b32f0bf1e`
(frozen qualification). The sole catalog conflict retained the new articulated
shadow integration test and removed only the two old positions of tests now
grouped at the core head. All four upstream registrations remain.

`.qa-dev/t14-main-integration-9CwQXe/receipt.json` passes at `b32f0bf1e`:
sixteen focused tests, including the native four-cascade shadow fixture, then
fresh T-14 centering/assets, types and public build. Tests include actual
factory shadow batching, context restoration, FIFO/browser barriers, catalog
exact-once coverage, T-14 high/low full-stroke rollers/ERA/negative space and
Shtora. Qualified profile, anatomy, projection and image files remain
byte-identical to the frozen release. The expanded final catalog has **951
entries** (301 / 611 / 39); this focused integration is **not** a claim that all
951 ran as another uninterrupted npm lifecycle. No failed result is relabeled.

This checkpoint changes no strict frame-time requirement. The independently
published renderer optimization retains its documented timing failure.
