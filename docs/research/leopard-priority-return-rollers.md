# A7V X and Revolution: fitted return rollers

Only `leo2a7v_x` and `leo2_revolution` opt in. This delivery is isolated from
published `508bb19b0`; it does not activate the separately developed A4M X,
A5 X or KF51 X changes. There is no `leo2_revolution_x` registry alias.

## Source basis and geometry

The Slovak Ministry of Defence's [October 2009 military publication](https://www.mod.gov.sk/data/files/1420.pdf),
printed page 26 (PDF page 25), explicitly describes four return rollers per
side on Leopard 2. The count follows that real chassis arrangement; the
stations below are fitted to each existing procedural model, not claimed
measurements of the source document or copied A6M stations.

| Vehicle | Fitted Z stations (m) | Axle absolute X (m) |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Leopard 2A7V X | −2.05, −0.35, 1.25, 2.20 | 1.300 |
| Leopard 2 Revolution | −1.93, −0.29, 1.25, 2.06 | 1.132 |

Each vehicle gains eight real 95 mm-radius, 160 mm-wide rotors and eight
finite painted spindles. The shared closed `efficientReturnRoller` primitive
has rubber crown and camouflage-aware wheel-metal groups. Native running
gear owns rotor placement, spin, damage and disposal; stationary shafts
share the hull owner and remain visible with the rollers at distant LODs.
The shafts extend from absolute X 0.965 m into the finite hubs, with more
than 25 mm lap into the existing hull skin. No floating decorative supports
or material-only substitutes are added.

The helper adds fitted upper support spans through the canonical track-loop
builder. It retains the original end crowns, complete lower course/contact
and lower end arcs, road-wheel geometry/axles, suspension settings, hull,
turret, cannon and authored equipment. Actual track length and pitch are
recomputed by the same native course; the formerly unsupported upper run
is not falsely described as unchanged. Neither target needs inner-band
lining or the protected-outer-face option.

Complete rotor plus spindle cost is **160 triangles HIGH / 80 LOW**, or
**1,280 / 640** across each vehicle's eight instances. The published general
roller recipe would cost 336 / 192 per assembly. Required roller count,
positive stock and finite attachment are retained. This is not a complete
vehicle performance, draw-call or tank-switch-latency acceptance claim.

## Focused contract

The two-ID test retains the five-model candidate's exact physical checks,
without importing or authenticating the unrelated A5 lining. It compares
all original authored emissions and actual body/material/rig/road-wheel
buffers against an exact old-gear-input control. It measures every native
road axle reaching the rig's configured compression and droop, checks finite
road/band/near-and-far-shoe stock throughout motion, and checks actual
render-eligible support gaps at 15, 75 and 200 m. The fixed support limit is
6 mm and numerical nonpenetration tolerance remains 2 micrometres.

The independently calibrated shared test helper and its default/hydraulic/
override regression are included because they are absent from this main
baseline. They do not change runtime suspension. Apart from the two profile
call sites and new helper, the only core edit exports the existing
`RunningGearConfig` type. No global roller default changes.

The existing A6M eight-roller HIGH/LOW control and the T-62MV-1 X zero-roller
control remain executable. The latter follows the US Army's description of
the [rollerless T-62 in FM 100-2-3](https://www.trngcmd.marines.mil/Portals/207/Docs/MCIS/ITEP/RITC-East/FM%20100-2-3.pdf).
Invalid stations and roots plus a deliberately raised penetrating roller
are rejecting controls. Rotor/spindle geometry and instance buffers must
each be disposed exactly once, including the real far battle LOD.

## Fresh results on the isolated two-ID tree

The implementation is saved locally as `53ebf5e44`. Fresh focused checks
PASS: 16 actual native Node constructions, 256 motion poses and 12 rejecting
controls, plus the shared calibration unit's nine measured poses and three
rejecting controls. Each native road axle reaches configured +0.30 m
compression and −0.22 m droop within the unchanged tolerance.

| Vehicle | Minimum road-stock separation, H / L (mm) | Maximum rendered-support gap, H / L (mm) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Leopard 2A7V X | 41.050 / 41.045 | 0.858 / 3.275 |
| Leopard 2 Revolution | 20.916 / 20.983 | 0.815 / 3.243 |

The gap checks retain actual band/shoe visibility, material groups, element
counts and LOD state at all three distances. Here the real draw-eligible
band supports the rollers; the farther shoes alone are not mislabeled as
contacting. The complete continuous shoe bound is at least 10.701 mm for
A7V and 8.701 mm for Revolution. Maximum sampled track numerical residual
is only 0.042 micrometres, inside the unchanged 2 micrometre tolerance.
Finite mounting, exact retained body/road/lower-course witnesses, LOW/far
persistence, A6M/T62 controls and exact-once geometry/instance disposal pass.

Both receipts record identical before/after input hashes and exclude private
oracles and temporary QA from the commit:

- `.qa-dev/leopard-priority-focused-qO9uX1/receipt.json`: PASS. SHA-256
  `c25d4f06ef454ceb11fc151b8fd745bc4c475bde0df44540981ac7996433d67a`.
- `.qa-dev/leopard-priority-types-tgGNNj/receipt.json`: full
  `npm run typecheck` and `core-unused-check` PASS. SHA-256
  `b49e9cc167155c5fb8a8c40880e2fccfe4fe656e261154823503967c55a9ce32`.

These focused tests are procedural Node geometry and render-state checks,
not GPU pixels. Earlier five-model passes do not substitute for these fresh
receipts; neither full-fleet performance nor publication is claimed here.

## Native rendering and early source comparison

The exact isolated implementation also passed 48 native GPU captures:
two vehicles × HIGH/LOW geometry × factory/winter finish × front-left,
rear-left and left views × 15/75 m, at 1200 × 800. Texture quality stayed
HIGH independently of geometry quality. Input-stability and finish-pair
checks passed with no rendering errors. Near-view review found no visible
running-gear blocker. Skirts occlude most return rollers, so these pictures
are not substituted for the explicit count and contact measurements above.

- Native receipt: `.qa-dev/priority-leopard-release-GUep7p/receipt.json`,
  SHA-256 `37b1e046f0a623b741252287110d22532bf45f9bb2dfc0804deea7f055df71d5`.
- Native manifest: `.qa-dev/priority-leopard-release-GUep7p/native/tank-assets.json`,
  SHA-256 `24b9c70e2563b3466b633db4bbd1609994e96e6d03e96f848bad66786e5ab825`.

An early HIGH-geometry source diagnostic passed all nine original-policy
views per vehicle, with zero browser errors or unavailable references:

| Vehicle | Aggregate fidelity | Lowest view | Unchanged per-view floor |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Leopard 2A7V X | 94.031929 | 92.246480, left | 92 |
| Leopard 2 Revolution | 93.912351 | 92.031900, left | 92 |

Revolution's margin is only 0.031900 points; do not describe it as a broad
accuracy margin. No scoring, camera, registration, threshold or runtime
changes were made to obtain this pass. The diagnostic used the isolated
cache/resource-cleanup runner now published in `f9f3a4cfa`, with the priority
tree's unchanged scoring page and source registrations. Its receipt pins
the exact external runner and matching before/after runtime/oracle hashes:
`.qa-dev/leopard-priority-source-early-RJHUSc/receipt.json`, SHA-256
`042ed518589f367795ce6bbbd35fb70616a24301f8a42de998d5ad893d897a1c`.

## Anatomy and generated-asset preflight

The required anatomy update/check sequence also passed, using separate FIFO
leases per phase. All 174 playable anatomy and marking receipts are current;
combat-anatomy tests pass, and 1,496 modules plus 348 track sides produce zero
hit-probe failures or outside-envelope modules. The probe retains 79 fleet
dimension-drift warnings; this roller pass does not claim to fix those
existing fleet dimension differences. All 522 playable technical diagrams
passed geometry/metadata freshness. The two requested tanks then regenerated
their 20 normal/technical gallery outputs. No unrelated output changed.

Only `tracks` changed in the two generated anatomy rows: hull, turret,
structures, crew and module data remain identical. Generated images and
manifest changes are limited to `leo2a7v_x` and `leo2_revolution`.

Nine-phase preflight receipt:
`.qa-dev/priority-leopard-release-uc4HQY/receipt.json`, SHA-256
`3b65051024b55f23e3963f4ccf7dccf2b6c5be24d95f4c8e6e8c49c7acedfc9c`.

The early source run and anatomy preflight are not a complete release. The
composed two-ID release gate remains required before pushing the playable
changes. Private source meshes and temporary captures remain excluded from
tracked changes.

## First composed release: targeted gates pass, regression run blocked

The fresh two-ID composed command on `ae57717a8` passed anatomy freshness,
centering, module alignment/hits, gallery freshness, track duplication,
round barrels and open bores, nine-view source fidelity, strict geometry,
track clipping/sweep, contiguity and fittings. Raw geometry minima are
92.207143 for A7V and 92.031900 for Revolution against the unchanged 92
floor. Only those two geometry-gate records and ledger rows changed.

The command then failed in npm PRE at the unrelated
`chieftain10XMk5Foundation.selftest.mjs` immutable Mk5 scene assertion.
The failed receipt is retained unchanged and is **not** a release pass:
`.qa-dev/priority-leopard-release-abi9JJ/receipt.json`, SHA-256
`3ccbe02e4b84a5af2d02671936776a905909e26b24b1e8f78f18055828992c77`.
All tracked runtime/tool/test inputs remained unchanged throughout that run.
CORE, POST and the private build were not reached. A fresh complete release
remains required before publication; neither the targeted passes nor later
diagnostic continuations waive this regression failure.

## Complete integration acceptance

The unchanged roller implementation subsequently passed the complete
[nine-ID release](nine-tank-bodywork-rollers-integration-20260909.md#complete-nine-id-release--pass)
at `6c27d4f2d`: all target gates, 858 ordered regressions, and both builds.
Its actual roller regression includes 16 builds, 256 articulated poses and
12 rejecting controls, with all original body/road-wheel witnesses retained.
The runtime projection metadata was synchronized to the existing captured
images; no image or anchor was re-framed. This supersedes the unfinished
release boundary above without relabelling any failed receipt. Broader
unpublished return-roller candidates remain outside this checkpoint.
