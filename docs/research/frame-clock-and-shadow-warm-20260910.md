# Battle frame ownership and loading-only shadow work

## Scope and evidence boundary

This follows `draw-submission-attribution-20260910.md`. It changes neither the
60 Hz presentation cap nor its 1.5 ms early-admission tolerance, graphics
quality, simulation frequency, shadow resolution or moving-cascade cadence.
It is not a claim that every historic stall has been explained.

## Garage input was restarting the active battle clock

The globally captured `pointerdown`, `wheel`, `keydown`, `touchstart` and
`resize` events called `noteGarageActivity` regardless of phase. That called
`invalidateGaragePresentation`, which unconditionally invoked
`frameLoop.restart()`. Restart cancels the pending animation callback and
rebases the scheduler's absolute presentation deadline. Repeated movement
keys therefore disturbed Battle scheduling even though Garage was not shown.
Retained asynchronous Garage producers could invoke the same invalidation.

Both callbacks now enforce Garage ownership. Foreign-phase input does nothing;
late Garage visual completion still records `garagePresentationDirty`, but
does not wake Garage services or restart Battle/Studio scheduling. Boot's
early dirty-only callback is unchanged. Phase changes and context recovery
keep their explicit restart owners; normal viewport synchronization still
runs in Battle and Studio.

The scheduler regression executes the actual callbacks and listener
registration extracted from `main.ts`, against the real scheduler. It covers
all five input events in Battle and Studio, asynchronous dirty-only completion,
Garage idle wake and repeated two-second battle keydowns. A negative control
removes only the two new guards: it must reproduce three animation-callback
cancellations and a changed presentation grid. This establishes the source
bug independently of any interpretation of the browser timing sample.

One maintained sixty-second early-control-release Verdant run, pinned fourteen
tanks, movement/firing plus 29/29 trusted camera pulses. Native Chrome151 /
ANGLE Metal Apple M5 Max, high, 1280×720/DPR1/scale1/trim0. No profiler, draw
attribution, console errors, foreign headless renderer or detected contention.
Every submitted endpoint matches the retained raw native callback timestamp
and draw count; preceding zero-draw callbacks remain in each cohort.

| Metric | Pre-fix result |
| --- | ---: |
| Submitted intervals | 3,601 |
| Frame median / p95 / p99 | 16.7 / 18.6 / 25.2 ms |
| Median FPS | 59.9 |
| Draw median / maximum | 778 / 870 |
| Texture estimate | 161.5 MB |
| Raw / floor heap growth | 1.42 / 1.35 MB/s |

The unchanged timing and heap-growth gates **FAIL**, exit1. Post-window forced
GC leaves 265.8 MB, but there is no matched pre-window forced-GC measurement:
neither leak-freedom nor an actual retained leak follows from this sample.

Of 106 intervals whose raw duration is at least 24.9 ms, 101 contain three
regular native callbacks (individual gaps 6.3–10.4 ms) with submissions
`[0, 0, positive]`; 96 of these are followed by a one-callback catch-up. The
other five include a longer native callback gap. Ten additional raw values
just below 24.9 round to 24.9 at one decimal; they are not silently included.

Thus most measured long submission intervals cannot be explained by missing
native sampler callbacks. The first fixed-grid mismatch is near the first
two-second steering boundary, but the raw series has no exact key-event or
restart stamps. Do not attribute every interval to a specific input event,
or apply this explanation retroactively to untraced 214–319 ms stalls.

## Loading-only shadow correction

The caster cohort selector previously tested only the presentation camera's
layers. Native shadow routing also enables layer29, so those omitted proxies
remained casting in every warm cohort. Selection now uses the same effective
mask. Regression coverage includes actual articulated batches and noncasting
retained sources, hidden ancestry, material visibility, LOD restoration,
object/vertex cohort limits, throws, yields and disposal. Each selected caster
warms once in the bounded cohort stage; all four final cascades still include
every eligible caster.

A far-away offscreen camera is not sufficient to skip forward submissions:
unculled objects still draw. `renderShadowOnlyWarm` is a synchronous,
known-router-and-camera-owned scope. It preserves the camera's normal mask
during native light/LOD collection and exposes layer29 during shadow traversal.
Only after successful owned shadow rendering does it clear that warm camera's
mask for forward/transmission object draws. `finally` restores the exact
caller's mask; replaced or unknown routers fail open to ordinary rendering.
Injected callbacks, regular warm uploads and compiler paths remain unchanged.

This removes unnecessary **draw submissions**, not all renderer work:
projection, object upload checks, sorting, light setup, background preparation
and transmission allocation/clear/resolve work may still occur. Native-v3
extends the existing exact-image fixture with ordinary and transmissive
unculled witnesses. Each witness must actually draw in the baseline and not
draw in the warm pass. Shadow RGBA must remain identical on the same owner;
the subsequent composed image must match without regenerating any shadow map.

## Qualification

The worktree was fast-forwarded to `ff0f639d97fb1d2660e9e7d463e2be8f26e31821`
before candidate checks. This preserves the other task's T-14 and test-runner
release; its 951-check catalog and native FIFO barrier remain unchanged.

Seven focused selftests pass: layer routing, deployment shadow warming, frame
scheduler, main frame integration, articulated shadows, offscreen warming and
test registry. Full typecheck/core-unused and the public production build pass.
These are proportionate checks for this render/input slice, not a claim to
have rerun all 951 catalog entries. Changed-scope pinned React Doctor0.9.13
exits0, with one test-only `async-await-in-loop` warning at
`deploymentShadowWarm.selftest.mjs:318`: each deliberate failure case awaits
its rejection and verifies restoration before disposing its owned resources.
It is not a production hot loop. No suppression or scanner configuration change
was made; `frame-warm-doctor-r1.json` retains the finding.

### Native warm preservation passes

`shadow-only-warm-native-r1/report.json`, SHA256
`c35c99b1604bc874167b737033ed36693e1b43d1fb22a61232a30eba8ebe7ed1`,
passes native-v3 on Chrome151 / native ANGLE Metal Apple M5 Max / Three185.
All eight warm cases remove six forward submissions, including both actual
witness objects (`[2,2]` baseline calls become `[0,0]`). Per-cascade shadow
counts are unchanged; all 32 same-owner raw shadow comparisons and all eight
unrepaired composed reveals are exact. The original six parity/reset cases
and two negative controls remain passing. The 190 retained RGBA files are
artifacts, not 190 independent cases. The final canvas was visually inspected;
fixture, browser, server and FIFO cleanup all pass with no errors.

### Candidate gameplay still fails the strict timing budget

One post-fix run used the same maintained protocol and acquisition hash as the
pre-fix run. Sources remained frozen, hash
`56761e254740b1d87206badf7da43fee15dcd9cfbca374eb91cd0d6f4d8da909`;

  `30d4ea6632d67b81fc8514e97401e00104ea6473685ef42b54a1c9f7de7bcb15`.
- 3,599 submitted intervals; all keep four-cascade mask15. No console errors,
  foreign headless renderer or detected contention; exact pinned roster matches.
- Frame median/p95/p99: **16.7/23.4/25.6 ms**. Median/p5 FPS: **59.9/42.7**.
  These still fail the unchanged limits. No tail improvement is claimed.
- Draw median/max: 786/864. Texture estimate:166.9 MB. Heap raw/floor slope:
  -0.26/-0.45 MB/s. These budget rows pass, but the unmatched post-GC endpoint
  does not certify absence of leaks.

Overall result remains **FAIL**, exit1. The exact input regression establishes
the phase-ownership correction; this single varying native run neither proves
a frame-time improvement nor isolates the remaining timing tail. It is not
repeated to search for a green sample.

The candidate raw callback labels can be reproduced exactly by the unchanged
60 Hz/1.5 ms scheduler without any resets (7,075 comparable callbacks, accounting
for the sampler's one-callback observation lag). The initial deadline is fitted,
not observed; this is evidence consistent with restored single-grid ownership,
not proof of native frame-time improvement. The remaining early/late submission
pattern therefore needs separate evaluation rather than another Garage fix.

### Actual local controls pass

audio-clock, Garage-gesture, warm-readiness and source-readiness gates.
All failure/error/cleanup arrays are empty. Day battle, night rematch and
returned Garage screenshots were visually inspected; the owned preview server
was stopped after the probe's browser cleanup.

| Battle Again | 140.6 ms | 5,632.1 ms | 67.1 ms |
| Return to Garage | 88.8 ms | 341.2 ms | 46.6 ms |

Ready times include countdown/readiness; these are not steady-state FPS.
Random bot compositions differ from prior live runs, so lower transition
totals are not an isolated loading-speed estimate. The cold audio startup and
strict gameplay timing limits remain separate outstanding issues.

In the separate complete local caster-stage observation, both Battle and
Rematch select 70 casters rather than the old 48, including all 22 named
layer29 map-wreck proxies. Each observed proxy submits once; the caster stage
contains 57 distinct shadow submissions and zero forward submissions, versus
1,452 total entries across the older repeated cohorts. Submitted entries are
not serialized cohort membership, and the old identity capture was capped.
All four final cascades remain, while intentional geometry-upload forward
work is unchanged. The final-cascade identity capture is still capped, so
its full phase classification is not inferred from that receipt. These
observations verify the mechanism, not a causal timing estimate.

The strict gameplay FAIL remains open. The candidate's 117 three-callback
slow cohorts reject the second source callback with a 1.500–1.667 ms deadline
deficit, just beyond the unchanged 1.5 ms allowance. A fitted model accounts
for these outcomes, but actual scheduler-entry wall time was not recorded.
Measuring that directly is the next diagnostic; changing a tolerance merely
to pass is not a fix. Historical untraced 214–319 ms stalls remain unproven.

## Direct scheduler clock observation

The opt-in `--scheduler-trace` observes the actual frame owner's eight numeric
decision fields, using bounded preallocated storage. The sampler records the
owner sequence at callback entry, so joins no longer depend on a fitted phase
or assumed callback ordering. Errors detach the diagnostic without changing
gameplay; incomplete/overflowed evidence refuses qualification. This mode
never certifies speed or appends performance trends. No RAF, renderer or
quality override is installed.

One sixty-second native early-release capture used the unchanged admission
policy, pinned Verdant roster, movement/firing and trusted camera input:

- `scheduler-owner-trace-r1.json`: SHA256
  `cdc002c1808b1cc340fbc782dd3c9a618ecd302e083edf33e00026dad2f831a3`.

- 7,074 actual scheduler decisions: 3,600 admitted, 3,474 rejected, no sampled
  restart/reset changes; zero trace drops/errors, exact owned disposal.
- Entry lag relative to RAF: median0.2/p951.0/p992.6/max27.2 ms. Of 300
  rejected callbacks within2 ms of their deadline, 203 had actually entered
  within the existing1.5 ms allowance. These are measured clocks, not inferred
  missing CPU/GPU work.
- No console errors or detected contention. Timing remains a diagnostic FAIL:
  median/p5FPS59.9/40.2, framep9925.9 ms. It is not a speed comparison.

Review found that the initial collector did not itself reject absent/corrupt
sampler-boundary rows. The collector and negative tests were tightened after
this frozen capture. The original artifact is retained unchanged; its actual
7,074 boundary rows were separately checked for finite increasing RAF times,
safe/nondecreasing owner sequences within the captured edges, and an exact
terminal RAF/count match. All pass. This is explicit postvalidation, not a
claim that the older acquisition contained the later validator. Sustained
mode's start time is the arm clock, not an observed RAF callback; sequence
boundaries remain authoritative for ownership.

Replaying only these recorded timestamps from the **observed** first deadline
reproduces all old decisions with zero mismatches. Using callback-entry time
only for eligibility, with unchanged RAF-based absolute progression, produces
the same3,600 admits and reduces modeled owner-RAF intervals>=24.9 ms from190
to59. Observed-clock pairs<7 ms remain3. This is a counterfactual scheduling
model—not measured performance of the changed implementation, since different
render work can change future callback arrival times.

The independent clock distinction follows the browser contract: RAF callbacks
share their frame timestamp even when earlier callbacks have already consumed
time; it is not identical to entry `performance.now()`.
[MDN requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame).
Simulation must retain its original RAF timestamp. No cap/tolerance increase,
graphics reduction or success-threshold change follows from this observation.

### Corrected eligibility clock

The scheduler now reads callback-entry time once and uses it for eligibility
and its starvation-watchdog wall latch. It still passes the original RAF
timestamp into simulation/render integration and advances the same absolute
RAF-based deadline grid. Cap60 and tolerance1.5 ms are unchanged. The optional
observer reuses this clock read; it adds no second read or ordinary-runtime
storage. Invalid, behind-RAF or regressing injected samples fall back to RAF.
The injected clock contract requires the same monotonic time origin; a finite
far-ahead foreign-origin value cannot be distinguished from actual callback
delay without an arbitrary cutoff, so none is invented.

Tests cover independent clocks at30/59.94/60/75/90/119.88/120/144/165/240 Hz,
zero-lag equivalence, bounded variable entry lag, exact deadline progression,
tick-cost independence, invalid-clock recovery, diagnostic errors and disposal,
idle/focus/hidden-host lifecycle. This is not a rolling minimum-spacing rule:
genuinely late callbacks can still produce close wall-time pairs. It cannot
remove browser/OS pauses or prove the historical stall cause.

### Silent preparation at actual boot entry

Only an accepted trusted Garage splash-entry key/pointer gesture may call
`audio.prepare()` before the opaque splash dismisses. Synthetic events,
modifiers, splash controls, Studio, automatic gate skips and programmatic
dismissal do not prepare audio. Ready/Battle retain their retry paths. The
optional prepare call skips muted/master-zero intent, creates no graph/tone
and adopts the same context later. This moves native construction out of
normal first-Battle entry, not off-thread or out of existence. No-splash users
still exercise the original cold Battle fallback.

The lazy audio facade now latches persisted/live master volume and mute before
the full mixer arrives. A separate single output gain controls the fallback,
including retiring fade tails, so envelope ramps cannot override exact-zero
mute. Full-mixer setters can latch safely before its graph exists; the graph
therefore begins at the intended gain rather than briefly sounding and fading
down. The normal authored envelope and native context options remain intact.

The existing no-splash Garage-orbit gate still requires zero constructors before
Battle. A separate `--boot-audio-gate` requires an opaque ready splash, real
trusted entry, exactly one constructor within that gesture and the same count
through Battle, rematch and Garage return. These are distinct fixtures, not a
relaxed assertion. Constructor/clock receipts are not PCM or audible-output
proof. New DOM/actual-mixer regressions cover negative entry paths, repeated
ready/dismissal, muted/volume-zero startup and source-start gain ordering.

### Native candidate and actual-control verification

The new unprofiled sixty-second candidate retains the pinned 14-tank Verdant
roster, high 1280×720/DPR1/scale1 graphics, movement/firing, trusted camera input
and all four shadow cascades. Chrome151/ANGLE Metal M5 Max; source remained
unchanged throughout; no detected contention, foreign headless process or
console error. The trace observer was disabled.

| Entry-clock candidate | 3,599 | 16.7 / 17.6 / 23.1 | 17 | 34.9 |

The candidate passes the unchanged p5 FPS (56.8), p99 frame-time, draw-call
(782 median/878 maximum), triangle, memory, load, input-coverage and roster
checks. The complete budget remains **FAIL**: median FPS is 59.9 against the
unchanged ≥60 gate. No cap, tolerance, display-quality or reporting-threshold
change is used to make that pass. One run is evidence of improved observed
tails, not repeatability, a physical presentation measurement or proof of the
historical stall cause. Acquisition hashes differ because the opt-in trace
plumbing was added; both compared captures have tracing/profiling disabled.

Two independent fresh-profile local actual-control fixtures pass functional,
audio-clock, warm-readiness and source-readiness gates; their day battle,
night rematch and returned Garage images were visually inspected:

- Boot entry: `entry-audio-local-boot-r1/report.json`, SHA256
  `1c99d21fe793784ea4b3f41dc97d2959127305e6907cb38d4baa107012f0a257`.
  The one native constructor takes 142.2 ms within the trusted splash-entry
  handler, before dismissal; counts stay one through both battles and return.
- No splash: `entry-audio-local-nosplash-r1/report.json`, SHA256
  `2458cd080d9074cbcbb1a14f1f57d219aa7e70bc0c4842af3ada4e4a2f3d8c84`.
  Actual Garage dragging still constructs no audio; Battle owns the one cold
  constructor and later actions reuse it.

| Fixture / action | Click → cover | Click → ready | Maximum callback gap |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Boot / Battle | 29.4 ms | 6,374.8 ms | 121.4 ms |
| Boot / Battle Again | 141.2 ms | 5,516.1 ms | 64.9 ms |
| Boot / Garage | 91.3 ms | 333.6 ms | 48.6 ms |
| No splash / Battle | 17.8 ms | 6,503.3 ms | 162.9 ms |
| No splash / Battle Again | 142.1 ms | 5,650.2 ms | 66.4 ms |
| No splash / Garage | 90.1 ms | 340.3 ms | 46.0 ms |

These functional windows include covered preparation and countdown, with
different runtime bot rosters; they are not matched throughput comparisons.
They explicitly retain nonzero loading pauses. Native startup is relocated,
not eliminated, and no-splash still exercises the cold fallback.

Thirteen distinct focused selftests, typecheck/core-unused and the public production
build pass. The registry validates 953 ordered checks; the full 953-check
suite was not rerun for this slice. Pinned React Doctor exits successfully;
its three new warnings are confined to intentional serial audio tests and
repeated gain reads that assert changes after mutation. They are retained,
not suppressed or converted into concurrent shared-global test execution.

### Published entry-clock/audio slice

`8850e95c7cd944de733c66731b132030e25c3ce5` was pushed non-force and verified

One constructor completed during splash entry (144.6 ms), before Battle;
the same context served both battles and Garage return. No errors or cleanup
failures. All three result screenshots were visually inspected.

| Public action | Click → cover | Click → ready | Maximum callback gap |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Battle | 3.6 ms | 9,029.5 ms | 190.8 ms |
| Battle Again | 141.7 ms | 5,525.1 ms | 65.6 ms |
| Garage | 84.1 ms | 317.9 ms | 47.2 ms |

The native frame improvement above was measured against the local production
build, not this public functional window. The live first-Battle loading gap
remains: callback-start diagnostic 5,068.7–5,259.6 ms (190.9 ms), covered and
visible during “Placing structures.” Its one overlapping Long Task accounts
for 76 ms; 114.9 ms remains unattributed. Audio construction ended at 2,775.2 ms,
before the Battle click at 3,565.7 ms, and its clock advances during this gap.
Thus moving audio startup did not eliminate all loading pauses. The recorded
props slice maxima lack absolute timestamps and cannot be assigned to this
gap; a targeted action profile is required before attributing the remainder.
