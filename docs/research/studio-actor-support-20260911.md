# Studio actor support, 2026-09-11

Storyboard tracks now retain authored horizontal motion while the ordinary
movement support solver controls chassis height and attitude. Replay starts
from canonical state, preserves explicitly staged hydraulic pitch, and steps
support on the global 60 Hz timeline. Display refreshes do not restart settling.

Focused tests use the actual movement solver on flat/sloped surfaces and
compare uniform/cue-subdivided cadence, backward replay and hydraulic staging.
Typecheck and public build pass. Native `studio-native-support-r3` passes the
15-second duel, all four rails, FX controls, JSON round-trip, video recording
(339084-byte VP9), and Garage return. Earlier r2 playback timeout is retained
as a failed run; its unchanged five-second gate passes on r3.

Ground diagnostic `studio-ground-contact-r4/report.json` measures actual
rendered wheel/track vertices against analytic terrain and raycasts selected
lower pad points against rendered terrain triangles. Minimum analytic pad gaps
span -13.667 to +17 mm. Rounded transform hashes repeat after backward seeking;
this is not a deformed-buffer identity certificate. Selected lower pad points
span about -200 to +184 mm against rendered terrain, reflecting terrain mesh
sampling and curved end stock. This does not qualify an entire loaded run or
resolve every terrain/model discrepancy. The old half-metre hover estimate
from an offset shadow alone is unsupported. These diagnostic images retain
Studio authoring guides and are not marketing outputs.

Independent review found the canonical reset and explicit hydraulic fix sound;
no new support-code blocker was identified. Full combined launch testing and
performance ceilings remain separate requirements.

## Encoder startup correction

The promo capture exposed a cold-encoder deadlock: after one dirty opening frame, paused Studio rendering stopped while playback waited for captured bytes. The live tick now keeps submitting the held zero-time composition until the first nonempty chunk. It preserves the10second timeout and routes a later requestFrame failure through the same owning-session cleanup as initial startup failures.

The actual recording and tick test covers a recorder that needs five frames, cancellation, timeout, later priming failure, stale events and retry. Latest typecheck and public build pass. Native promo UI r3 records Studio successfully and completes Garage/battle/Gallery/Docs capture at `.qa-dev/launch/promo-current/ui-r3`; optional local-preview analytics failures remain separately recorded. The HUD capture does not establish a target kill.

## Recorder time after stalled frames

The20-scene native run exposed a15.838s file for the15s scene12 timeline.
The interactive delta cap discarded elapsed time while MediaRecorder kept
wall-clock timestamps. During recording only, timeline advancement now catches
up to the elapsed recording instant, excluding the measured encoder lead-in
and bounded at the storyboard end. Existing ordered effects and60Hz actor
support steps are retained. Normal interactive playback remains unchanged.

Actual-method recording/access tests pass, including800ms encoder startup,
slow frames, endpoint clamping, cancellation and retry. Independent source
review passes. Native scene12 rerun passes the original duration gate in
`.qa-dev/launch/studio-wall-clock-native-r1.log`. The full20-scene rerun remains
separate. Correct duration cannot recover frames lost to a browser stall.
